I have decided to contribute to this Open Source Project called 'simple-contribution' by 'ammyalex'. {https://github.com/amyyalex/simple-contribution.git}

First of all I opened an issue using the issues option.
I then forked the repository to my github account using the create a repo option.
I then cloned the repo into my local machine using github desktop.
I then opened it into my Vscode directly from github desktop.
On my vscode i modified the readme file, saved the changes  and then commited them with a commit message to my forked repository.
I then pussed the changes and submitted a pull request.
I then copied the repositories url for submission purposes.

ISSUES ENCOUTERED
1. I was having issues in using these commands when using the gitbash terminal, however this was made easy by the github desktop as the steps are simple and self explanatory.
